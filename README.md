# Power_Of_Math_Application
End-to-End AWS web application We’ll pick five different services—Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway and DynamoDB—and talk about why/where to use them, and how to get them to work with each other.  As we go, we’ll build out each of the services, resulting in a fully-functional math web application.
